# ✈️ Air Cargo Analysis — SQL Capstone Project

### 📊 Overview
This project provides a detailed **SQL-based analysis of air cargo operations**, focusing on route performance, customer spending, and stored procedure–based summaries.  
It demonstrates core SQL skills — database creation, complex queries, joins, views, and procedural logic — executed in **MySQL Workbench**.

---

### 🎯 Objectives
- Evaluate **air cargo routes** based on distance and cargo metrics.  
- Identify **revenue contribution** by ticket class and customer.  
- Apply **stored procedures** for automated reporting.  
- Present actionable insights from SQL-based data analysis.

---

### ⚙️ Tools & Technologies
- **MySQL 8.0 Workbench**  
- CSV imports & relational joins  
- Stored procedures and aggregate functions  
- Analytical queries and view creation  

---

### 🧮 Datasets
| File | Description |
|------|--------------|
| `customers.csv` | Customer details linked with ticket records |
| `routes.csv` | Flight routes, origin–destination pairs, and distance |
| `passengers_on_flights.csv` | Flight wise cargo and passenger stats |
| `ticket_details.csv` | Booking details and ticket prices |

*All datasets were provided under Simplilearn’s Business Analytics with SQL Capstone program for educational use.*
